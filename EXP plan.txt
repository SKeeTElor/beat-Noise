Under room temp/70k

Creat freq shift by B0-magnetometry:

B0 not changing, do the denoise measurement, then close negative feedback, do the meansure ment again, . We should have 2 part of data, 1st part is without noise, the 2nd part is with noise. 

Then th rest is just data processing.



The genral idea:

The negtive feedback gonna make the cantilever stifer, and our thermal noise amplitude is x =
